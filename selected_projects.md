## Novel Diagnostic Modality of Pediatric Airway Stenosis


## Surigal planning for tracheal reconstructive surgery


## Development of novel aerosolizer technolody



## Development of a low-emission biomass cookstove

Nearly half the world's population still rely on respiratory-harming biomass stoves for cooking and heating. We leveraged air injection technology to reduce particulate emissions by 90% in biomass cookstoves. CFD results show improved mixing with increasing jet momentum. Open-source <a href='https://www-sciencedirect-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/science/article/pii/S0973082621001083'>designs</a> integrated into two <a href='https://burnstoves.com/products/wood-stoves/turbo'> manufactured</a> stoves.

## Prediction of Aneurysm Treatment Outcome using Computational Fluid Dynamics


<img src="../images/cfd_aneurysm.png" alt="cfd aneurysms" width="100%">

The primary treaetment method for cerebral aneurysms are endovsacular deployed coils and stents, however high raites of treatment failure still persist. We developed a computational pipeline that incorporates patient-specific anatomy, blodd-velocity, and pressure data to model blood-flow in patients before and after treatment. By comparing changes in engineering metrics following treatment to patient outcomes, we identify metrics that are predictive of treatment failure - enabling data-driven treatment prescription.

## Experimental Characterization of Anerusym Fluid Mechanics

To further investigate the possible mechanics of cerebral aneurysm treatment failure, particle image velocimetry measurements were obtained from idealized treated aneurysm models. It was found that under certain flow and anatomic conditions, flow inside the aneursym cavity was found to oscilate direction during the cardiac cycle, creating a flow environment that is preventative of clot formation and healing

## H2Go: Expanding Irrigation Access 

<img src="../images/H2GO.png" alt="h2go" width="100%">

Access to irrigation water is a significant barrier to crop production throughout the developing world. We developed a pumping system that is powered by motorcycles - the ubiqutous mode of transportation in the areas of need. A buisiness model was established and tested in Uganda that created an excess income for motorcycle/taxi drivers and increased irrigation for 400 farmers by XXX. See here for more information

  Hey there! This page is included as an example. Feel free to customize it for your own use upon downloading. Carry on!
</p>

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/poole/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mdo).

Thanks for reading!
