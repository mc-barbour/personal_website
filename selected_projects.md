## Novel Diagnostic Modalities for Pediatric Airway Stenosis

<img src="../images/robin_image.png" alt="robin" width="100%"> 
 
We are developing a suite of engineering analysis and clinical imaging-based tools to investigate the airflow dynamics in patients with Robin Sequence, Tracheal Compression, and Subglottic Stenosis. These pathologies are characterized by an obstruction in the airway, increased work of breathing, decreased quality of life and possible mortality. Using a combination of in-silico and in-vitro techniques we quantify the airflow dynamics in diseased patients. By comparing engineering metrics and clinical outcomes, we aim to risk stratify patients and identify the need for surgical interventions. <a href='https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10439-022-03036-6'>Here</a>, a comination of 4D-CT & CFD is used to quantify flow profile in Robin Sequence patients, and then risk stratify a pilot set of patients based on severity of breathing resistance. Our risk ranking was found to correlate with clinical severity.

## Development of a low-emission biomass cookstove 

<img src="../images/cookstoves.png" alt="cookstoves" width="100%"> 

Nearly half the world's population still rely on respiratory-harming biomass stoves for cooking and heating. We leveraged air injection technology to reduce particulate emissions by 90% in biomass cookstoves. CFD results show improved mixing with increasing jet momentum. Open-source <a href='https://www-sciencedirect-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/science/article/pii/S0973082621001083'>designs</a>  were integrated into two <a href='https://burnstoves.com/products/wood-stoves/turbo'> manufactured</a> stoves.

## Prediction of Aneurysm Treatment Outcome using Computational Fluid Dynamics


<img src="../images/cfd_aneurysm.png" alt="cfd aneurysms" width="100%">

The primary treaetment method for cerebral aneurysms are endovsacular deployed coils and stents, however high raites of treatment failure still persist. We developed a computational pipeline that incorporates patient-specific anatomy, blood-velocity, and pressure data to model blood-flow in patients before and after treatment. By comparing changes in engineering metrics following treatment to patient outcomes, we identify metrics that are predictive of treatment failure - enabling data-driven treatment prescription.

## Experimental Characterization of Anerusym Fluid Mechanics

<img src="../images/piv_aneurysm.png" alt="piv aneurysms" width="100%">

To further investigate the possible mechanics of cerebral aneurysm treatment failure, particle image velocimetry measurements were obtained from idealized treated aneurysm models. It was found that under certain flow and anatomic conditions, flow inside the aneursym cavity was found to oscilate direction during the cardiac cycle, creating a flow environment that is preventative of clot formation and healing.

## H2Go: Expanding Irrigation Access 

<img src="../images/H2GO.png" alt="h2go" width="100%">

Access to irrigation water is a significant barrier to crop production throughout the developing world. We developed a pumping system that is powered by motorcycles - the ubiqutous mode of transportation in the areas of need. A buisiness model was established and tested in Uganda that created an excess income for motorcycle/taxi drivers and increased irrigation access for farmers. See <a href='https://www.ghlabs.org/open-access-items/h2go-uber-for-irrigation for more information'>here</a> for more information.

  Hey there! This page is included as an example. Feel free to customize it for your own use upon downloading. Carry on!
</p>

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)
