<!--I'm senior research scientist & engineer at the University of Washington. My primary research interests are in cardiovascular and respiratory fluid mechanics with a special emphasis on improving the efficacy of treatment devices, optimizing surgical techniques, and developing novel diagnostics. I have a strong background in fluid mechanics and engineering principles and expertise in both numerical and experimental methods for characterizing flow environments. I also have extensive experience in medical image segmentation, data analysis, image processing, prototyping, and optics. 

#My career research goal is to improve patient outcomes by translating research findings into novel healthcare technologies, updated clinical practice, and improved understanding of the biological processes. Over the course of my career, I am applied these skills to develop diagnostic tools for characterizing airway obstructions, design, prototype, and anaylize inhalation nebulizers, and  develop predictive models of cardiovascular treatment outcomes. For more information on past and current projects see here (link).-->

My primary motivation is to improve patient outcomes by translating research findings into novel healthcare technologies, updated clinical practice, and improved understanding of biological processes.  I have a special emphasis on cardiovascular and respiratory health and recent projects include developing quantitative diagnostics for airway obstructions, design and testing of a novel drug aeorsolizer, and creation of predictive models of aneurysm treatment outcomes. 
 
My research combines computational modeling (CFD) with multiple laser-based flow measurement techniques including particle image velocimetry and phase doppler particle analysis. I also have extensive experience in image segmentation and processing, data analysis and modeling, engineering design, prototyping, and the optical systems. -->

I'm a research scientist and engineer at the University of Washington sitting at the intersection of healthcare and engineering. I apply the principles of fluid mechanics and use advanced engineering analysis to address healthcare challenges, particularly related to cardiovascular and respiratory disease and interventional technologies. My primary motivation is to improve patient outcomes by translating research findings into novel healthcare technologies, updated clinical practice, and improved understanding of large-scale flows in the human body. Recent projects include developing quantitative diagnostics for airway obstruction, design and testing of a novel drug aeorsolizer, and creation of predictive models of aneurysm treatment outcomes.
