I'm senior research engineer/scientist at the University of Washington with a passion for healthcare and human-centered technology R&D. With 10 years of work experience in academic and industrial labs, I have expertise in computational and experimental engineering analysis; product development; data science; human physiology; image analysis and optical measurement systems development. 

More coming soon.
